# Bird_System

This is a Bird System I've made for Unity 3D games, mostly used in Open World.

## How to setup:

-- Step 1:
<br/>
<br/> - Create an empty named BirdSpawner in the scene where you wants the birds
<br/> - Add the BirdSpawner componant to the empty GameObject "BirdSpawner"
<br/> - Add your Bird GameObject to the BirdSpawner component (your bird must have an Animator Avatar)
<br/> - Make an Animator Controller with one Idle bird animation, and then add it to the BirdSpawner component
<br/> - Set the number of birds you want, the spawn radius (which will also be the range where the birds can go, they can't go out of this radius)
<br/> - Set the min height and max height, it define the height range where birds can fly
<br/> - And now you can hit play and it should be working
